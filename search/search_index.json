To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an OAuth link. Once done, the bot can offer a switch_inline button so that the user can easily return to the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline capabilities.

Why isn't my bot responding? # Well first of all, have you programmed it? I know it might sound crazy, but 99% of the people that ask this question didn't actually program their bot. Rather they just created a bot with BotFather and expected things to magically work. If the answer to that question is \"yes\", as I hope it is, then there are a few things to try. First of all, make sure you are using the correct API token for the bot you're trying to access. If you have multiple bots it can become pretty easy to accidentally grab the wrong token. Assuming you have the right token, be sure to check that your bot is actually running and that you have a working internet connection. Try running your bot with the LOG_LEVEL environement variable set to DEBUG and check the logs. When running in polling mode you should see a whole bunch of calls to getUpdates . If that didn't work, you may need to check if group privacy mode is turned on. Go to BotFather, send the command /mybots , select your bot, go to Bot Settings > Group Privacy > Turn off . This should only be necessary if your bot is running in groups and you're using non-standard command prefixes, or other handlers like the HearsHandler . Lastly be sure to check the commands you're trying to send. The standard CommandHandler will only respond to commands with the / prefix. Also be sure to remember that command names should be unprefixed. For example: - @[Command(\"/echo\")] + @[Command(\"echo\")] What messages can my bot see? # Depends partially on whether group privacy mode is turned on or not. As a general rule your bot will not see messages sent by other bots. There is no way around this. If your bot is an admin in the group it will see all messages, except those sent by other bots. With group privacy mode turned on (the default) you bot will receive: Commands explicitly meant for them (e.g., /command@this_bot ). General commands from users (e.g. /start ) if the bot was the last bot to send a message to the group. Messages sent via this bot. Replies to any messages implicitly or explicitly meant for this bot. Additionally all bots, regardless of the group privacy mode will receive: All service messages. All messages from private chats with users. All messages from channels where they are a member. Note Eeach particular message can only be available to one privacy-enabled bot at a time, i.e., a reply to bot A containing an explicit command for bot B or sent via bot C will only be available to bot A. Replies have the highest priority. Can bots delete messages? # Yes, under 2 conditions: The bot must have the Delete Messages permission The message must be less than 48 hours old How can I add my bot to a group? # Same way you add any other user. On the desktop client this can be done by clicking the ellipses in the top right corner while viewing your group, clicking Info , and then clicking the Add button. If your bot is meant to be added to groups you can make this a bit easier by giving users a link to do so. The URL for the link should be http://telegram.me/BOT_NAME?startgroup=botstart where BOTNAME is the username of your bot. How can I get a user's information? # Bots are not capable of accessing a user's information soley based off of their user id or username, however there are some ways around this. The simplest is to keep a record of each user your bot comes in contact with by watching incoming messages for the user that sent them. An example of this could be as follows: @[ On ( :message ) ] def persist_users ( update ) if message = update . message # Convenience method to get all users from a message users = message . users # ... add them to a database end end The one exception to this rule is chat members . If you know the user's id or username and a group that they belong to which your bot also belongs to, you can use #get_chat_member to get their ChatMember record. I have a question not listed here, where can I ask? # Feel free to join the official Tourmaline/Proton Chat on Telegram and ask away.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"resources/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"This is an FAQ for Tourmaline, but the answers should be generalized enough to use as a general FAQ for Telegram bots.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"resources/faq/#why-isnt-my-bot-responding","text":"Well first of all, have you programmed it?

Well that is the question I aim to answer in this brief introduction. If you already know how to make a bot, and would like to focus more on how to make a bot with Tourmaline, feel free to skip to the Getting Started . The BotFather # Every journey has to start somewhere, and for the would-be Telegram bot developer that is BotFather . BotFather itself is a Telegram bot which allows you to create and manage your own bots. As is convention, you can start BotFather by starting a conversation and pressing the \"Start\" button or sending the /start command. To create a new bot, just send the /newbot command. BotFather will then ask a couple questions which sometimes confuse people. Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.\" The first question is asking for the screen name of your bot. This is the name that will appear when it sends messages and not its username. Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in bot . Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot. Now this is your bot's username. As it states, your bot's username must end with the word \"bot\". Capitalization doesn't matter, but ending with the word \"bot\" is pertinant. I won't go into more detail as to how to setup a bot here as you can just run /help to see all of the available commands, but once you finish the bot creation you will be presented with an API Token. KEEP THIS SAFE . Your token is for your eyes and your eyes only, as anyone with half a brain can take your token and use it to control your bot maliciously. We will also need this token later, so keep it handy. Running Your Bot # A bot is nothing more than code running on a computer somewhere. In most cases during development and testing that computer will probably be your own, but what happens when you're ready to share your bot with the world? At that point, running your bot on your own local machine isn't the best idea. Personal computers need to sleep, be restarted every now and then, and have more important jobs than hosting a bot 24/7. Enter the VPS. If you already have a server on which to run your bot, or are at least familiar with how to deploy your bot elsewhere you can probably skip this section. For anyone left remaining, you need a server. Far and away the most affordable method of getting your own server is by using a VPS, or virtual private server. Providers like AWS, DigitalOcean, Vultr, and Hetzner (my personal favorite) provide these for as little as $2-5/mo. To use a VPS you will need some knowledge of Linux, including how to use ssh to remotely access a server. If Linux is foreign to you I highly recommend getting aquainted, as it's going to be very important going forward. We will go into more detail about how to actually run your bot on your VPS later in this guide. Avoiding Limits # Telegram bots are heavily limited in what they can, and cannot do. The good news is that these limits are mostly documented when it comes to bots, so avoiding them is completely in your control.

Installing Tourmaline # This guide assumes that you have Crystal installed and are at least semi-familiar with the syntax. The first thing we are going to need is a fresh Crystal project, so go ahead and run crystal init app your_bot_name , making sure to replace \"your_bot_name\" with whatever you want to call your bot. I'm going to use the famous echo_bot example. Once it's finished, cd into the project directory. Now, open shard.yml and add the following lines anywhere in the file (probably at the end): 1 2 3 dependencies : tourmaline : github : protoncr/tourmaline Save the file, and run shards install . That's it! Tourmaline is now installed. Creating Your Bot # Now it's time to write some code. Open src/echo_bot.cr or whatever file was generated for you, and paste in the following code. The code is annotated so you can understand what's going on every step of the way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 require \"tourmaline\" # (1) client = Tourmaline :: Client . new ( ENV [ \"BOT_TOKEN\" ] ) # (2) echo_handler = Tourmaline :: CommandHandler . new ( \"echo\" ) do | ctx | # (3) text = ctx . text . to_s ctx . reply ( text ) unless text . empty? # (4) end client . register ( echo_handler ) # (5) client . poll # (6) First we have to import Tourmaline into our code. In Crystal this is done with the require statement. Next we create a new Client object. This is the main object that we will be using to interact with the Telegram Bot API. Into the Client we pass our bot's API token, which we will be getting from the BotFather. We will be storing this in an environment variable, so we use ENV[\"BOT_TOKEN\"] to get the value of the BOT_TOKEN environment variable. If you are not familiar with environment variables, you can read more about them here . Tourmaline uses a system of handlers to handle different types of events. In this case we are creating a CommandHandler which will handle the /echo command. The first argument to the CommandHandler is the name of the command, and the second argument is a block of code that will be executed when the command is received. The block of code is passed a Context object, which contains information about the command and the message that triggered it. The Context object has a text property which contains the text of the message that triggered the command. We can use this to get the text of the message and reply with it. We use the reply method to send a message back to the chat that the command was sent in. We also check to make sure that the message isn't empty, because if the user just sends /echo without any text, the message will be empty. Now that we have created our handler, we need to register it with the Client so that it can be used. This is done with the register method. Finally, we call the poll method on the Client to start the bot. This method will block the current thread, so it is important that you call it at the end of your code. And that's really all their is to it.
